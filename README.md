- **Slow scanning**: Increase minimum file size threshold (--min-size 10)
- **Memory issues**: Close other applications during large scans

### Performance Tips
- Use higher minimum file size (5-10MB) for faster scans
- Scan specific drives instead of all drives
- Close unnecessary applications during scanning
- Use SSD storage for better I/O performance

## 📋 System Requirements

- **Python 3.7+**
- **psutil library** (for drive detection)
- **tkinter** (included with Python, for GUI version)
- **Windows, macOS, or Linux**

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Cloud storage integration (OneDrive, Google Drive)
- Scheduled scanning with task scheduler
- Advanced filtering by file type, date, etc.
- Storage analytics with charts and graphs
- Network drive support for enterprise environments
